Starting Pitch

- Problem
    - Difficult to keep track of tasks/ideas
    - A lot of school websites with information everywhere. Users will be able to retrieve all that information and summarize it in their bullet journal for easy tracking.
    - Complex applications just to write down notes
- Appetite
    - Our project will have a relatively short time frame around 5 weeks. Because of this, we do anticipate certain limitations to our solution. We might not be able to implement the full feature set of our product we agreed upon. We do hope that our project will at least implement  core functionality as well as drop and drop/export features in our MVP (Minimum Viable Product).
- Solution
    - Ease of Use
    - Intuitive
    - Customizability
- Rabbit Holes
    - Journal first and foremost
- No Go's

Wireframes

Potential Blockers (To ask Jordan)

- What libraries can we use
- How do we generate PDFs to export
    - Website/project name
