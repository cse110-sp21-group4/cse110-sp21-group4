    # Outcomes

    - Need a single view of at least the page titles along with tasks and calendar
        - ideal home page
    - Need to search using:
        - word (might be difficult)
        - labels in each page
    - Journal book with dashboard displaying live feed
        - Live feed:
            - Calendar - Click on the day and filters pages by date
            - Tasks - Shows tasks from
                - all pages (might not work)
                - selected page
- Based on journal book theme we have 2 views:
    - **Home**
        - Many pages (discuss next what each page looks like) in the center
        - Left - Navigation bar with all the **labels**
            - Labels used to filter the pages on click
        - Right - **Calendar -** filters pages by date
        - Bottom right **Tasks** to show
- Each Page
    - 2 pages left and right
    - Drag and drop form a toolbar things like:
        - Text (including word art)

            Text box

            **Tasks - (which will be showed on home page)**

            Tables

            Images

            Links

    - Labels will be added
        - On text (like comments on Google Docs) (might be difficult)
        - Assign to page
        - little detail thought: add using command like (/label CSE110) (might be difficult)

# Potential blockers to think of in future

- Tracking tasks across all pages might be difficult
- Searching by words
- Toolbar functionality
- Drag and drop functionality
- Labels on text
