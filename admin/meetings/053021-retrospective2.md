# What went well?

- Yang is the GOAT
- Better Teamwork
    - We have made good progress this week
    - Loved the increase communication between each person
    - I think everyone has been given responsibilities, we all have contributed
- UI looks good
- Everything got made, I think our app looks pretty close to completion

# What didn't go well?

- Need More Time
    - Not enough time left to code or to do other stuff
    - Need extra time to work on the projects
- Incomplete Project
    - App isn't as polished as we'd like but not much we can do due to the structure of the class
    - Not all the components were implemented
    - The requirements that the class sets for us is kinda bs. 100% test coverage is a pain in the ass, so I guess we gotta get tests done fast
