## What are the current problems?

### Unclear, not enough time

- Hard to learn JS completely from scratch just based on the labs
- I think that it's a bit unclear on what we should be doing sometimes because some aspects are dependent on other tasks
- I am learning literally nothing from lectures LOL

### Need to commit more

- I think we might have to meet more often
- I feel like more features or things should have been done by now
    1. Have at least 1 stand up meeting with your partners.
    2. Wednesday 1pm for weekly meeting

## What went well?

### Meetings

- I think that the meetings we've had are pretty productive
- Weekly meeting to catch up on stuffs
- Teammates are friendly
- Most of the people got to contribute

High Fidelities were dope
