- Decide to not use any of the code from the exported XD files
    - May use it as inspiration
- Updated the README file to include coding practices
- Pull request to merge `add text on click`
    - There is a bug, where text is being added on every click anywhere on screen
    - Want to fix it to only add text in a certain area on the screen
- Fixed styling issues throughout css files
- Two possible ways to proceed with future implementation:
    1. Creating a single page application (merging all html files)
    2. Putting all html files in Shadow DOM

- Controller Component
    - Main page controller
    - Since we are planning to have a single page application, we can have a main page controller
    - If we decide to go a different route with other html files, we can create other controllers
