Date: May 17, 2021
Participants: Zhongkang Fang, Darian Hong, Bozhi Wang, Christopher Vu, RJ Singh, Yang Lu, Ishaan Gupta, Tri Tran
Type: Sprint Planning

Time Started: 2:00pm

Time Ended: 3:00pm

- Decide to not use any of the code from the exported XD files
    - May use it as inspiration
- Updated the README file to include coding practices
- Pull request to merge `add text on click`
    - There is a bug, where text is being added on every click anywhere on screen
    - Want to fix it to only add text in a certain area on the screen
- Fixed styling issues throughout css files
- Two possible ways to proceed with future implementation:
    1. Creating a single page application (merging all html files)
    2. Putting all html files in Shadow DOM

- Controller Component
    - Main page controller
    - Since we are planning to have a single page application, we can have a main page controller
    - If we decide to go a different route with other html files, we can create other controllers

## How do we increase value/utility?

- Communicate immediately on general if you're stuck
- Be more open to coding, once you start, you'll keep getting more comfy with js
- More meetings

## Helpers

- Good coordination
- Yang!
- Please read the instructions in the repo.

## Blockers

- Lack of knowledge of components and js
- Work from other classes (some of which people are behind in) and the labs for this class
- Covid

## Proposed Sprint Goal

- Try to have individual components working
- That would have merging things together easier :)
