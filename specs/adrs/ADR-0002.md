- Status: **Accepted**
- Deciders: **@RJ Singh @Zhongkang Fang @Darian Hong @Bozhi Wang @Yang Lu @Tri Tran @Christopher Vu @Ishaan Gupta**
- Date: **2021-04-26**

## **Considered Options**

Options for View

- ‚≠ê 1 - Calendar, Tasks and pages
- üü° 2 - Pages listed side-by- editing pages
- üü© 3 - Pages listed + Calendar + Tasks (can be filtered by Label, search words and date selected on calendar)
- üî∫ 4 - open book

Options for Editing

- Type plain text (possible different font)
- Drag and drop

## **Decision Outcome**

### 1. View:

**Chosen option:** Website should look like a book as soon as you open it.

- 3 would be our home page, but the calendar+ events, reminders and tasks will not appear by default
- By default does not show index, pulled form left pane
- Can always pull calendar, reminders and tasks (eg: from buttons on the right) to get a big picture

**Chosen option:** zoom + - feature

**Chosen option:** 4 will be how the individual pages look

**Chosen option:** We'll store the coordinates and paths used to build each page in the local storage

**Chosen option:** Have a calendar with events below, reminders, and tasks\

**Chosen option:** Have labels in a drop down pop up in the top bar

### **Positive Consequences**

- More homely feeling.
- User can type as soon as they enter the website.
- Gives user a lot more features and organizing journal notes and tasks
- Search bar will give the user to look up notes and/or labels across different pages
- Local storage makes navigation and revisiting old pages intuitive and maintain score functionality

### **Negative Consequences**

- Not as modern or minimalistic (not going for it though)
- Possibly filter might be difficult to implement. (Rabbit hole)

## **Pros and Cons of the Options**

### **[** ‚≠ê 1 **]**

- Good, because Calendar, pages and tasks can be viewed side-by-side
- Bad, because can't look up by labels
- Might be too much at once

### **[** üü° 2 **]**

- Good, because can walk through different Pages easily
- Good, because can change page while editing and come back
- Bad, because difficult to track tasks/events across pages

### **[** üü© 3 **]**

[example | description | pointer to more information | ‚Ä¶]

- Good, because can view pages by default
- Good, because can view calendar when needed
- But this is not the complete app, page editing mode different view
- HENCE CHOSEN AS HOME PAGE

### **[** üî∫ 4 **]**

- Good, because can view different labels on journal entries
- Good, because can view calendar and tasks at all times
- But this is not the complete app, pages viewing mode different
- HENCE CHOSEN AS EDITING INDIVIDUAL PAGE VIEW

### 2. Editing

Options:

[ Type text ]

Pros:

- Important aspect of Bullet Journals is typing
- Users just open a page and start typing

Cons:

- Adding images in particular positions, like putting text all around an image
- Missing on more creative uses people use Bullet Journal in

[ Drag and Drop]

Pros:

- Enables Adding images in particular positions, like putting text all around an image
- Users use in any way they want, looks closer to real Bullet Jounals

Cons:

- Adding text more difficult

## Decision Outcome:

- Best of both worlds
- Drag and drop but
- Make text tool selected by default and a default cursor position (like somewhere top left) so the user can directly start typing
